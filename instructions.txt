The following commands must be executed for the application to run:

pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install gspread
python tunts_rocks_challenge.py

Also, Python must be installed.

This code also needs a JSON file just like the sample one in the repository (googleapi-keys-sample.json). Since it has personal information (private API Ket) that can lead to 
unwanted access to my Google Drive, the JSON file that actually has been used is unnavailable. To get Google Drive/Google Sheets API Keys, just follow the tutorial available in the 
gspread documentation (https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/oauth2.html#enable-api-access-for-a-project) to run the code properly. The result is exactly the one that can be seen in the 
Google Sheets file. Thus, the JSON file path in line 51 must be changed to the downloaded JSON file path, so the code gets your Google API Keys. 
Also, there can be a "Bad Request" error while trying to run the code. This is a connection problem during the HTTP request. Just stop the code and run it again that it certainly is
going to work.
